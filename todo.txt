* see a web page local
  - hit localhost and get 200
  - title should be set
  - should be able to locate content in the page
  - apparently I should be able to set up an e2e but also a unit test
* deploy web page to remote
* make an api that returns a list of regions
* make api get regions from PostgreSQL
* deploy pg-driven api

We need to have a protractor test up and running.
